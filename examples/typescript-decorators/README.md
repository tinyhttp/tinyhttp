# TypeScript decorators example

Minimal [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) example that uses [ts-node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node) and [express-decorators](https://github.com/sjmeverett/express-decorators) package in order to organize the HTTP methods in controller classes.
This way you can separate the logic based on the entities you use.

## Setup

```sh
pnpm install
```

## Run

```sh
pnpm start
```
